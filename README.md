# Calculator Project from The Odin Project

This is the calculator project. This one did not take as long as I expected. I was particularly proud that I did not view any other completed projects to complete this one. I did Google a few minor areas that I will explain below. I learned what helped me was to read the project then take some time off to think it through before putting pen to paper.  This helped me outline everything in my head, functions, and which methods to use.  There are so many ways to do things, I had to decide if I would use a grid, flexbox or table to build the calculator. I ended up doing both a grid and a table! There are def areas I am not clear on though. When I finished, I took a look at other projects and saw a lot of callback functions, [i]'s, and other code I wasn't sure how to use. I was at least familiar with some of it. I am not as versed in arrays, although I saw a lot of them in other coders' projects.
## Google'd areas
I did Google how to append a second number into the display (how 1 and 2 would become 12). I also googled the use of 'parseFloat()' to convert my number values to actual numbers. I also was not sure if I should use a textbox or a blank div w/ innerHTML for the display. (ended up with the textbox)
## Unfinished Areas
I was not quite able to 100% complete the project. Here's a shortlist of known areas:
1) The calculator doesn't take more than one set of numbers. I figure an array is the solution here, but I was unsure of the details and wanted to go ahead and push the project to GitHub. 
2) In my second version, the percentage and other added buttons do not work. I just did not take the time to update the functions. I think I could have if I took some more time to figure the code.
3) The keyboard support and backspace functionality is missing
## Final Insights
Areas I know I need to tighten up are in arrays, arrow functions, and callbacks. Despite this, I felt really good with this one. I understood and did not have nearly as much trouble as I expected. I will likely revisit these areas and possibly rewrite the code as I am more comfortable with the code.
